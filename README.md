Csd, acronym of "CodeIgniter Spa by DaSCoS", is a framework for SPA applications (Single Page Application: more info) based on the CodeIgniter 3.1.0 framework, which we have extended with the integration of the xajax framework to manage the logical part that creates the Spa, of jquery for advanced features and functions and Bootstrap for the graphic part. Csd framework allows you to create rich web applications that offer a smooth and interactive user experience.

CodeIgniter is a lightweight and flexible PHP framework that focuses on development speed and simplicity. It uses the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern to separate presentation logic from business logic. In this way, robust and maintainable web applications can be created.

Xajax, on the other hand, is an AJAX framework for PHP that makes it easy to implement AJAX functionality in a web application. This framework allows you to make AJAX calls to the server without having to rewrite the PHP code. Additionally, xajax offers a number of useful features, such as data validation and error handling.

Bootstrap is a CSS and JavaScript based front-end framework that provides pre-built and responsive UI components. With Bootstrap, you can quickly create an attractive and easy-to-use user interface, without having to write a lot of CSS or JavaScript code.

JQuery is a lightweight and fast JavaScript library that makes it easy to manipulate the DOM and interact with the server via AJAX. With jQuery, you can write clean and compact JavaScript code, saving time and effort.

Together, these frameworks allow you to build a powerful and interactive single-page web application with an attractive and responsive user interface. With xajax integration, you can use AJAX features to improve user experience and make your application more efficient. Also, thanks to the use of Bootstrap and jQuery, you can quickly create a high-quality user interface without having to write a lot of code.

In summary, Csd is a fork of CodeIgniter 3.1.0 that offers a rich and interactive user experience thanks to xajax integration and the use of Bootstrap and jQuery. With Csd, you can create attractive and efficient single page web applications quickly and easily.
